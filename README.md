## About AnilistRPC
AnilistRPC is a Discord Rich Presence (RPC) integration for Anilist. With authentication support, which actively updates your profile and reflects your current activity on Anilist.

### Features
- Seamlessly updates your Discord profile with your Anilist activity.
- Authentication support ensures a personalized experience.

### Limitations
- Currently, **manga** is not supported. However, support is planned for future updates. The limitation arises because Discord would only allow status messages such as "Watching Manga" or "Playing Manga," which are not ideal representations.
